## History

The MadDonkeySoftware Cloud spawned from a learning experiment to create a state
machine atop of another open source functions-as-a-service (FaaS) project. After the
initial prototype was completed a desire to use the state machine / FaaS pairing to
coordinate bulk processing subtitle and video data on a home network. The original
author opted to keep these workloads inside of their home network rather than pay
for utilizing a public cloud. As a few more services were built the MadDonkeySoftware
Cloud began to form.
